# Nats-blitz 

This repository contains the source code for a multiplayer game built in Unity that uses the NATS.io messaging system, the game is designed to be run on desktop platforms, such as Windows and Mac.

*NATS.io* is a high-performance messaging system that enables communication between distributed applications. It provides a lightweight, scalable, and flexible publish-subscribe messaging model that allows applications to exchange messages in real-time. NATS.io is easy to use and can be integrated with a wide range of programming languages and frameworks.

The project is part of the **LFX mentorship program**. LFX is a community-driven initiative that aims to connect developers with open-source projects and foster collaboration and innovation in the industry. As part of the mentorship program, I will be working with my mentor to develop this game and improve my skills in Unity and NATS.io.
